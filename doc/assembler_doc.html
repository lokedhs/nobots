    <h1>Assembler documentation</h1>

    <h2> Smalltalk </h2>

    <p>
      Each robot contains a virtual CPU that runs a program fed to it
      when the game is started. Each robot has its own memory and
      cannot touch or in any way affect the execution of the other
      robots programs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The CPU has, somewhat similar to the computers of the late 70's,
      separate memories for program and data. There are no
      instructions to manipulate the program memory, therefore it is
      impossible to create self-modifying code.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no registers or status flags like the ones found in
      most real CPU's. Instead, every instruction has zero, one or two
      extension words that can be used in different ways. What these
      extension words are used for is determined by bits in the
      instruction word. Usually, however, you can use all the features
      of the language without having to think about the internal
      representation of the instructions.
    </p>


    <h2> Addressing modes </h2>

    <p>
      There are four addessing modes, these are: immediate number,
      immediate symbol, dereferenced symbol and indirect symbol.
    </p>

    <h3> Immediate number </h3>

    <p>
      The immediate number addressing mode is the simplest. Whatever
      number you write in the code is the one used in the
      instruction. Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move 10,xyz
    </pre>

    <p>
      The immediate number here is the 10. This instruction results in 
      the value 10 being stored in the memory location pointed to by
      the value of the symbol <code>xyz</code>.
    </p>

    <h3> Immediate symbol </h3>

    <p>
      The immediate symbol addressing mode is similar to the immediate
      number. The number used is the value of a specified symbol. In
      the code, the symbol is preceeded by a %-sign. Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move %xx,yy
    </pre>

    <p>
      The immediate symbol is the %xx. This instruction stores the
      value of the symbol <code>xx</code> into the memory location
      pointed to by <code>yy</code>.
    </p>

    <h3> Dereferenced symbol </h3>

    <p>
      The dereferenced symbol addressing mode takes the value of the
      symbol and uses the value stored at that address in memory. Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move xx,yy
    </pre>

    <p>
      This instruction stores the contents of the memory location
      pointed to by <code>xx</code> in the memory location pointed to
      by <code>yy</code>.
    </p>

    <h3> Indirect symbol </h3>

    <p>
      The indirect symbol addressing mode takes the value of the
      symbol, looks up that address in memory and uses that value for
      another lookup in memory, that value is the one used in the
      operation. Example:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move &xx,yy
    </pre>

    <p>
      The indirect symbol here is &amp;xx. This instruction does an
      indirect lookup of <code>xx</code> and stores the resulting
      value in the memory location pointed to by <code>yy</code>.
    </p>

    <h3> Offsets </h3>

    <p>
      With all of the above addessing modes except immediate number,
      you can specify an offset that will be added to the symbol value 
      during assembly. The offset is specified using a / followed by a 
      number. Here is an example:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move xx/2,yy
    </pre>

    <p>
      This will look up the value stored in the memory location
      pointed to by the symbol value of <code>xx</code> plus 2 and
      store it in the memory location pointed to by <code>yy</code>.
    </p>


    <h2> Arrays </h2>

    <p>
      There is no
      difference between arrays and normal auto-allocated
      variables. If you do not use the <code>array</code> keyword to
      specify the number of words of memory the symbol value will
      point to, the size will be 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      The format for the <code>$array</code> keyword is:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	$array <em>symbol</em> : <em>size</em> [ <em>init-list</em> ]
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This will cause <em>symbol</em> to point to <em>size</em> number
      of words initialized with the contents of <em>init-list</em>,
      which is a comma separated list of integers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you specify an <em>init-list</em> then the <em>size</em> is
      optional, it will default to the number of elements in the
      <em>init-list</em>. You may not specify a <em>size</em> that is
      less than the number of elements in the init list. If you do not
      specify an <em>init-list</em> then the <em>size</em> parameter
      is mandatory.
    </p>


    <h2> Callbacks </h2>

    <h3> Installing and removing callbacks </h3>

    <p>
      A callback is a kind of interrupt. You set up a <em>callback
	handler</em> for a certain callback. A callback handler is set 
      up as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	callback <em>id</em>,<em>handler</em>
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      After this command, when event <em>id</em> occurs, the CPU will
      enter callback mode and jump to the location specified by
      <em>handler</em>. While the CPU is in callback mode all
      callbacks will be deferred until the program exists callback
      mode by using the command <code>rtc</code>, this command will
      also return to wherever it was before the callback was called.
    </p>

    <p>
      The handler for the callback can be removed by specifying the
      number -1 as the <em>handler</em>.
    </p>

    <h3> Accessing callback data </h3>

    <p>
      Some callbacks need to send some information to the callback
      handler. This information is called the <em>callback data</em>
      and is placed in a special location that is accessed using the
      command <code>getcb</code>. The format for this command is as
      follows:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	getcb <em>location</em>,<em>destination</em>
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This instruction takes the contents of callback data location
      <em>location</em> and places it in the memory location pointed
      to by <em>destination</em>.
    </p>



    <h2> Expressions </h2>

    <h3> Typing expressions </h3>

    <p>
      The assembler supports expressions wherever an integer is
      expected. Expressions are entered inside parentheses. For
      example:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	move (10+2*40),var
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the same as: <code>move 90,var</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep in mind that the unary operator -, is part of an
      expression, not a number. This means that if you want to enter a 
      negative number you have to enclose it within parentheses.
    </p>


    <h3> Defines </h3>

    <p>
      The assembler allows you to define mnemonics to be used in place 
      of an expression. The format for a define is as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
      <code>
	$define <em>symbol</em> = <em>value</em>
      </code>
    </p>

    <p>
      This will set <em>symbol</em> to be equal to
      <em>value</em>. After this, the symbol can be used in place of
      the value in any expression.
    </p>


    <h2> Runtime errors </h2>

    <p>
      Runtime errors are errors that prevent further execution of the
      program, such as: jump to a location outside program memory,
      trying to pop a value off the user stack when there are no
      elements on it or specifying an illegal value for a callback
      id.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whenever a runtime error occurs the CPU does the following
      things:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> Clears the user stack
      <li> Clears the system stack
      <li> Exists callback mode and clears any pending callbacks
      <li> Clears any pending messages
      <li> Jumps to program location 0
    </ul>

    <p>
      This will effectively restart the program with one important
      difference: the memory contents are not restored. If the program 
      relies on certain memory contents when started, it might not be
      properly restarted after a runtime error.
    </p>
