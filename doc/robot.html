    <h2> Embedded code </h2>

    <p>
      It is possible to embed the assembler source in the robot
      definition file. To do this, don't specify a source file using
      the <em>code</em> keyword and use the special keyword
      <em>end</em> to mark the end of the robot definition. Everything
      after the <em>end</em> keyword will be read in as the assembly
      source code for this robot.
    </p>
