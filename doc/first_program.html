    <h1>Explanation of a small program</h1>


    <h2> Machine description </h2>

    <p>
      They say the best way to learn is to learn by example so in this 
      section we'l take a look at a simple program that counts from 0
      to 10 over and over again:
    </p>

    <pre>
	#
	#  This is a program that increases the contents of the
	#  variable "counter" from 0 to 10. When it has reached 10 it
	#  is reset to 0 again.
	#
	start:
		move	0,counter	# initialize counter
	loop:
		add	1,counter	# add 1 to counter
		move	counter,tmp	# copy counter to tmp
		sub	10,tmp		# subtract 10 from tmp
		jne	tmp,%loop	# if tmp is not 0, jump to loop
		jmp	%start		# jump to the first instruction
    </pre>

    <p>
      I will now go though each instruction in this program,
      explaining what happens and hopefully even <em>why</em> it
      happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      First of all, it's important to understand the concept of
      "symbol values". Every symbol has a value. Whenever a symbol
      appears in an instruction the value of this symbol is stored in
      the extension word of this instruction. This value is then
      usually used to refer to a data memory location but it can also
      be used to specify a location in program memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I talk about "memory locations" I always talk about
      locations in data memory. As was said earlier, there are no
      commands dealing directly with program memory, so its hardly
      ever mentioned.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first 5 lines are comments. Comments start with a # and
      extend to the end of the line. The first non-commented line is
      the line:
    </p>

    <pre>
		start:
    </pre>

    <p>
      This is a label definition. What it does is that it <em>sets the 
	value of the symbol to the PC of the next
	instruction</em>. Since the next instruction is the first line 
      of the program the value of the symbol <code>start</code> will
      be 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next instruction is:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move	0,counter
    </pre>

    <p>
      This instruction stores the value 0 in the variable
      <code>counter</code>. Or, to be more precise, it stores the
      value 0 into <em>the memory location pointed to by the value of
	the symbol</em> <code>counter</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, all of this sounds nice, but what really is the value of
      the symbol <code>counter</code>? The answer is that during
      assembly, the assembler finds all symbols that have not
      receieved a value in some other way (i.e. through a label
      definition like the one we saw on the previous line), allocates
      one word of memory for each symbol and assigns the address to a
      memory location to each symbol. We do not set the symbol value
      of <code>counter</code> in our program so <code>counter</code>'s
      symbol value will indeed be that of the address to an unused
      memory location. Because of this we can simply take an unused
      name whenever we need a storage location and the assembler will
      automatically allocate it for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next instruction is just another label definition. Since it
      preceedes the second instruction in the program it will get the
      symbol value 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      The next instruction:
    </p>

    <pre>
		add	1,counter
    </pre>

    <p>
      adds the value 1 to the storage location pointed to by
      <code>counter</code>. The next instruction:
    </p>

    <pre>
		move	counter,tmp
    </pre>

    <p>
      Here, we move the <em>contents in the memory location pointed to 
	by the symbol value</em> of <code>counter</code> to the
      contents of the memory location pointed to by the value of
      <code>tmp</code>. <code>tmp</code> is a symbol just like
      <code>counter</code> so its symbol value is assigned by the
      assembler just like <code>counter</code>'s was.
    </p>

    <p>
      The instruction:
    </p>

    <pre>
		sub	10,tmp
    </pre>

    <p>
      subtracts 10 from the storage location pointed to by
      <code>tmp</code>. The next instruction:
    </p>

    <pre>
		jne	tmp,%loop
    </pre>

    <p>
      This means that the CPU should jump to the program memory
      location that is the symbol value of <code>loop</code> if the
      memory location pointed to by <code>tmp</code> is not 0.
    </p>

    <p>
      The %-sign deserves some explanation. If we had written
      <code>jne tmp,loop</code>
      it wouldn't work, because the CPU would make a lookup in the
      memory location pointed to by <code>loop</code> and then jump to
      <em>that</em> location in program memory. The %-sign prevents
      the memory lookup and uses the symbol value instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      The last instruction:
    </p>

    <pre>
		jmp	%start
    </pre>

    <p>
      This instruction jumps to the first line in the program so that
      it starts counting again.
    </p>
