When a robot fires its weapon, the weapon status is set to:

	weapon_recharge_status = weapon_power * weapon_explode_range


Every update the recharge values are set as follows:

	weapon_recharge_status -= weapon_recharge_speed
	scanner_recharge_status -= scanner_recharge_speed


When hit by a bullet (this formula should be affected by the distance to the
bullet):

	shields -= weapon_power


When scanning for robots:

	scanner_recharge_status = scan_width * 10


Stuff to do:

	o The bullet explode range is currently hardcoded to 1000
