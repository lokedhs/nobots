		   NoBots installation instructions

The NoBots distribution consists of three binaries: The game proper,
called "execute", the C2 compiler and the map editor. Each of these
has to be compiled separately.

First, edit the files Makefile.global and config.h to suit your
operating system. Then, type "make" to build the game. If you want to
build the C2 compiler, go to the "compiler" directory and type
"make". Similarily, to build the map editor, go to the "mapedit"
directory and type "make".
